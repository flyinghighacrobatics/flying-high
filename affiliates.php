                           Partner Acrobatics is a practice that consists of 2 or more people,
                            one person as the base, lifting and supporting another as the flyer
                             in static or dynamic postures and sequences.
                              The base may be in a lying or standing position and there are also transitions
                               between positions. Itâ€™s just lots of fun!!!<br><br>

<h3> Partner Acrobatics offer two types of trainings:</h3>
