This ZIP file is a package created for you at Nov 29 2015 11:47:04 GMT
by the FormMail Configuration wizard from www.tectite.com.

The package contains these files:
  fmsendmail.php        - your newly configured PHP FormMail script

  contactform-test.htm  - a sample HTML form configured for you (with automatic test data)
  contactform.htm       - a sample HTML form configured for you

  sampleform.htm        - a sample HTML form configured for you

  contact.html          - your converted HTML form

The next step is to upload these files to your web server.

First, make sure you take a BACKUP COPY of any files on your server before overwriting them.

Upload the files to your 'document root' (this is your website's top 
folder/directory, where you have your home page document).

Here's what we recommend you do after uploading the files to your server:

   1. Test FormMail's alert messages using this URL:
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/fmsendmail.php?testalert=1

      You should receive an email to info@flyinghighacrobatics.com.

      If you don't receive the email, then you have a problem
      with sending email from PHP on your server, or,
      a problem with a spam filter.
      In this case, please review this document for more information:
        http://www.tectite.com/fmdoc/emailproblems.php

   2. Test your sample forms, open these URLs:
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/contactform-test.htm
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/feedbackform-test.htm
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/sampleform-test.htm
      Submit the form.
      You should receive an email to this address:
        info@flyinghighacrobatics.com

   3. Use the sample forms to develop your own HTML form.

   4. These forms can be used immediately after uploading to your website:
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/contactform.htm
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/feedbackform.htm
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/sampleform.htm
        http://flyinghighacrobatics.com/contact.html
